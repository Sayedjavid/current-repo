Sure, let's break down the concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand way:

### Basics of Version Control and Git Branching

**Version Control System (VCS)**: 
Think of version control as a way to manage changes to your code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

**Git**: 
Git is a popular version control system used by many software development teams. It allows you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.

**Branches**: 
In Git, branches are like separate timelines where you can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase (often called `master` or `main`). Branches help keep development organized and allow different features to be developed independently.

### Understanding the Workflow

**Feature Branching**:
- When you want to work on a new feature or fix a bug, you create a new branch. This branch is isolated from the main code (`master` or `main`) 
  until it's ready to be merged back in.

**JIRA and Stories**:
- **JIRA** is a project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and manage their work. It's used to organize tasks and issues related to the project.
- **Stories** in JIRA represent units of work that need to be completed. They could be new features, improvements, or bug fixes. 
              Each story typically has a unique identifier (like `ECO-1111`) that helps track its progress.

### Putting It Together: Your Branching Strategy

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Every new branch you create should have a clear name. Using the JIRA ID in the branch name (`ECO-1111-create-api`) helps link the branch directly 
     to the task or story you're working on.

2. **Workflow**:
   - You start by creating a branch (`feature/ECO-1111-create-api`) from the `develop` branch. This is where you'll do your work for that specific feature or fix.
   - As you make changes, you commit them with messages that also reference the JIRA ID (`ECO-1111 xxx xxx xx`). This makes it easy to understand 
     what changes were made and why.
   - Once your feature is ready and tested locally, you create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch back into `develop`.
   - After the PR is reviewed, approved, and merged into `develop`, your changes are integrated with the main development branch.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Code from the `develop` branch is deployed to a development or testing environment (`DEV`) for further testing and validation.
   - If everything looks good in `DEV`, the code is merged into a `release` branch (`release/XX_X`). This branch prepares the code for a 
     specific release version (`XX_X` could be a version number like `1.0` or `2.0`).
   - The `release` branch is then deployed to a QA environment for thorough testing.
   - Once QA approves the release, it is deployed to production (`PROD`).

4. **Merging and Cleanup**:
   - After a successful deployment to PROD, the `release` branch is merged back into `master` (or `main`). This keeps your main branch up-to-date 
     with the latest stable version.
   - Old feature branches that have been merged and are no longer needed can be deleted to keep the repository clean.

### Summary

Your branching strategy is about organizing your work using branches, making sure changes are tracked and tested before going live, and maintaining a 
clear path from development to production. Each step ensures that your code changes are controlled and validated before reaching users.

If you're new to these concepts, it might seem overwhelming at first, but with practice and experience, it will become more familiar. 
Git and JIRA are powerful tools that streamline collaboration and help teams deliver software more efficiently and reliably.
